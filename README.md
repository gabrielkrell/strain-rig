## New version notes

Boards:
 - Arduino MEGA 2560 - controls stepper, reads force input.
 - HX711 - 24-bit ADC used to read force sensor. Uses [Queuetue HX711 library](https://github.com/queuetue/Q2-HX711-Arduino-Library/).
 - [EasyDriver](http://www.schmalzhaus.com/EasyDriver/) stepper driver. Max frequency 500kHz (2 us/cycle, far faster than motor can do).

Parts: 
 - [Stepper Motor](https://www.pololu.com/product/1200): 200 Steps/Rev, 1.2A/Phase. 9.09kHz (110 us/cycle) seems to be good max frequency.
 - [Linear screw](https://www.smw3d.com/sfu-1204-ball-screw-and-flanged-nut/): 4mm lead. See [ball screw guide](http://www.anaheimautomation.com/manuals/forms/ball-screw-guide.php#sthash.fK6LyzyL.WL0C372z.dpbs).

Interaction over serial:
 - Input `m12.3456789`: move up by input number in cm. Negative (down) allowed.
 - Input `z`: Zero the force sensor.

## To compile:
1. Install the [Queuetue HX711 library](https://github.com/queuetue/Q2-HX711-Arduino-Library/) (Library Manager > Queuetue HX711 library).

## Linux usage instructions

The actual UI isn't done yet, but you can still use it with the command line. To use on Linux, you can install the Arduino IDE (probably), or just use built-in terminal stuff:

1. Plug in the Arduino, and figure out which port it's on:
   `$ dmesg | grep tty`
  
   Example output:
   ```
   gabe@dormserver:~$ dmesg | grep tty
   [    0.000000] console [tty0] enabled
   [    1.341091] tty tty2: hash matches
   [1249326.491407] cdc_acm 3-2:1.0: ttyACM0: USB ACM device
   ```
   (Here, the Arduino will be `/dev/ttyACM0`.)
2. Make sure your user is in the `dialout` group, which lets you use serial devices. For example:	

   `sudo usermod -a -G dialout gabe`

   You may need to log out and log in again for this to take effect.
3. Now, set the tty parameters with `stty` (replacing `/dev/ttyACM0` with whatever your device is called):

   ```
   sudo stty -F /dev/ttyACM0 cs8 115200 ignbrk -brkint -icrnl -imaxbel -opost -onlcr -isig -icanon -iexten -echo -echoe -echok -echoctl -echoke noflsh -ixon -crtscts -hupcl
   ```
4. Now that the Arduino is attached, start saving the output in the background.  You can read from `/dev/ttyACM0` (or whatever the device is) like a normal file.  For example:

   `cat /dev/ttyACM0 > output.txt &`
5. You can check the latest output with `tail`:

   `tail output.txt`
6. You can write to the Arduino like you would any file or device. For example, to move up by 3cm:

   `echo "m3" > /dev/ttyACM0`

   As the rig starts moving, you should see the green LED on the front turn on.
7. To exit, run `fg` to bring the `cat` task to the foreground, and kill it with Control+C.  The output from this session will be saved in the file you specified in step 4.


Here's an example session in full:

```
gabe@dormserver:~$ dmesg | grep tty
[    0.000000] console [tty0] enabled
[459805.013211] cdc_acm 3-2:1.0: ttyACM0: USB ACM device
gabe@dormserver:~$ sudo usermod -a -G dialout gabe
gabe@dormserver:~$ sudo stty -F /dev/ttyACM0 cs8 115200 ignbrk -brkint -icrnl -imaxbel -opost -onlcr -isig -icanon -iexten -echo -echoe -echok -echoctl -echoke noflsh -ixon -crtscts -hupcl
gabe@dormserver:~$ cat /dev/ttyACM0 > output.txt &
[1] 30271
gabe@dormserver:~$ echo "z" > /dev/ttyACM0
gabe@dormserver:~$ echo "m1" > /dev/ttyACM0

gabe@dormserver:~$ fg

```

## Old version notes

Components:
 - Arduino Nano - controls other peripherals, manages UI. Uses [Arduino-PID-Library](https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library)
 - HX711 - 24-bit ADC used to read force sensor. Uses [Queuetue HX711 library](https://github.com/queuetue/Q2-HX711-Arduino-Library/).
 - Motor driver board with L298N: drives stepper motor.
 
Interaction over serial:
 - Input `m123456.789`: change setpoint to input number (in mm?).
 - Input `z`: Zero the force sensor.

Extra compilation steps: install the [Arduino-PID-Library](https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library) (Library Manager > PID by Brett Beauregard)

## Notes on calibration:

The [HX711](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/ForceFlex/hx711_english.pdf) is a 24-bit ADC, which, in our application, measures voltage from the load cell up to Â±20mV. The largest signed 24-bit int is 8388607. Thus, a change of 1 from hx711.read() corresponds to (1/8388607) volts.  For convenience, this unit is called "ticks".
